# TypeCrypt Haskell (Theory Branch)

This directory contains the formal specification and type logic implementation.

- `src/Types.hs` defines the core `Type` and `Value` algebra.
- Future modules will implement symbolic matching and encryption logic.

Run `cabal test` or `stack test` once tests are added.
