# TypeCrypt üîê

**TypeCrypt** is an encryption system where *types themselves are the key*. Decryption is only possible if a submitted value *resolves to the expected type*.

This repo contains three coordinated implementations:

- **Haskell** ‚Äì the *Theory Branch*: formal specification, correctness, and type-driven logic.
- **Rust** ‚Äì the *Production Branch*: hardened system for real-world usage, throughput-optimized.
- **Zig** ‚Äì the *Experimental Branch*: compile-time metaprogramming, radical flexibility, and rapid prototyping.

## üîç Concept

In TypeCrypt, types are not just annotations ‚Äî they are *structural constraints* that serve as decryption keys. A ciphertext encrypted under a type `T` can only be decrypted by a value of type `T`.

This flips conventional cryptography on its head: instead of using values to unlock data, you must *satisfy a type* to access it.

## Building & Testing

Each language implementation lives in its own subdirectory. To compile and verify them run:

- **Haskell**
  ```bash
  cd haskell
  cabal build
  cabal test
  ```
- **Rust**
  ```bash
  cd rust
  cargo test
  ```
- **Zig**
  ```bash
  cd zig
  zig build
  ```
