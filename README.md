# TypeCrypt 🔐

**TypeCrypt** is a novel encryption system where *types themselves are the key*. Decryption is only possible if a submitted value *resolves to the expected type*.

This repo contains three coordinated implementations:

- **Haskell** – the *Theory Branch*: formal specification, correctness, and type-driven logic.
- **Rust** – the *Production Branch*: hardened system for real-world usage, throughput-optimized.
- **Zig** – the *Experimental Branch*: compile-time metaprogramming, radical flexibility, and rapid prototyping.

## 🔍 Concept

In TypeCrypt, types are not just annotations — they are *structural constraints* that serve as decryption keys. A ciphertext encrypted under a type `T` can only be decrypted by a value of type `T`.

This flips conventional cryptography on its head: instead of using values to unlock data, you must *satisfy a type* to access it.
